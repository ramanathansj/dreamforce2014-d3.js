<h4>Report</h4>
Make sure you have deployed the report called “Dreamforce2014” which is used as backend data source for Bar, Line, Tree charts so without it, you may get errors. This chart is available in report folder.

<h4>Note</h4>
You need appropriate data for line/bar chart, there is same data in this repo it needs to be imported or you need to have good amount of data which is distributed over period of time. If you are importing data use data loader and make necessary mapping to account though it is not required for charting.
